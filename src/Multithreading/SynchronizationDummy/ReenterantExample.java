                                  to acquire the same lock multiple times without causing a deadlock. If a thread already holds the
                                  lock, it can re-enter the lock without being blocked. This is useful when a thread needs to repeatedly enter synchronized blocks or methods within the same execution flow. The ReentrantLock class from the java.util.concurrent.locks package provides this functionality, offering more flexibility than the synchronized keyword, including try-locking, timed locking, and multiple condition variables for advanced thread coordination.*/
